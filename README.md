# stochastic_reserving_in_R
A short and sweet R Shiny application to carry out stochastic reserving using Mack Chain Ladder methods.

This application is built to allow actuaries, analysts, and insurance professionals to:
  Upload and validate claims data.
  Construct incremental and cumulative triangles.
  Apply the Mack Chain Ladder method.
  Generate reserve estimates with uncertainty measures.
  Visualize diagnostic plots.
  Download all results in an Excel-friendly format.

-- Required R packages
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "readxl", "dplyr", "lubridate", "tidyr",
  "ChainLadder", "DT", "writexl", "ggplot2", "patchwork"
))

-- How it works
